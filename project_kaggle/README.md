Public Dataset Project (Kaggle) — Starter Outline

Goal
- Find a supply-chain dataset on Kaggle and perform a simple Clean & Viz to show shipping delays or inventory gaps.

Steps
1. Find dataset on Kaggle (search: "supply chain", "shipping delays", "inventory")
2. Download dataset and place raw files under project_kaggle/data/
3. Create a notebook (Jupyter or Colab) to: load, clean, and visualize one insight
4. Produce output: a PNG chart and a short writeup in project_kaggle/README.md
5. Commit results to this repo

Acceptance criteria
- One cleaned dataset file (CSV)
- One chart (PNG) showing an insight (e.g., delay distribution)
- Short writeup (1 paragraph) explaining insight and business meaning
